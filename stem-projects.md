#### Kvanta Educational STEM Project

In 2016 I co-founded [_Kvanta_](https://kvanta.xyz) and directed yearly STEM courses, reaching over **800 young learners** across 8+ years and inspiring interest in STEM. 

More than **3,500 teaching hours** have been delivered through weekly lessons and over 10 educational boot camps â€” both in-person and online (with up to 200 participants) â€” by our dedicated team of volunteer instructors and educators.

**Over $120,000** was secured in funding through grant applications and partnerships with educational institutions, IT companies and educators to support ongoing project development.

As a result of our commitment, many Kvanta graduates have continued their passion for science -- participating in domestic and international top-level competitions (IMO, IOI, EGMO etc.), enrolling in top universities across Europe and the U.S.
