### Educational Projects & Outreach

Since 2016, I have been actively contributing to the growth of Ukrainian STEM talents by teaching mathematics & programming at summer camps and school-year classes, organising educational programs and competitions, and fostering a vibrant community of learners and educators.

#### Kvanta Educational STEM Project ([kvanta.xyz](https://kvanta.xyz)), 2016–Present  
In 2016 I co-founded Kvanta and directed yearly extracurricular school courses, reaching over **500** young learners for **8+ years** and inspiring interest in STEM. 

Together with a dedicated team of undergraduate instructors, we have conducted over 3,500 hours of classes trough weekly lessons and organised more than 10 educational boot camps in both online and in-person formats. Over $100,000 was secured in funding through grant applications and strategic partnerships to support ongoing project development.

As a result of our commitment, many Kvanta graduates have continued their passion for science, enrolling in top universities across Europe and the U.S.
