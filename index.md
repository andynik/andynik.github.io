Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a computer science researcher specialising in AI and machine learning, with a focus on natural language processing and mathematical reasoning. I am currently a visiting postgraduate research student at the University of Cambridge, UK, working with [Professor Simone Teufel](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=GnKIYCcAAAAJ) and Dr. Yiannos Stathopoulos. My research explores the use of language models for mathematical data generation and problem synthesis.

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (KNU), where I work under the supervision of [Professor Anatoly Anisimov](https://scholar.google.com.ua/citations?user=WRxJxC0AAAAJ). I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. (with honours) in Computer Science from KNU in 2018 and 2020, respectively.

Outside academia, I'm passionate about STEM education for younger learners. Iâ€™ve taught and coordinated several initiatives, including Kontora Pi, PIT School, and Mathematical Olymp. Iâ€™m also the co-founder and director of Kvanta, a STEM project for schoolchildren.
