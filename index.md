Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andrii Nikolaiev, a computer science researcher from Ukraine.
Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. candidate at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (KNU), working under the supervision of [Prof. Anatoly Anisimov](https://dblp.org/pid/72/5294.html).
My research focuses on natural language processing, particularly large language models, data generation methods, and mathematical reasoning.

At the moment, Iâ€™m a visiting postgraduate research student at the University of Cambridge, working with [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/) and [Dr. Yiannos Stathopoulos](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~yas23/).

I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. (with honours) in Computer Science at KNU in 2018 and 2020, respectively.

Outside academia, I'm passionate about STEM education for younger learners. Iâ€™ve taught maths and programming, and coordinated educational programs, including Kontora Pi, PIT School, and Mathematical Olymp. Iâ€™m also the co-founder and director of Kvanta, a STEM project for schoolchildren.
