Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a visiting researcher at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/) and [Dr. Yiannos Stathopoulos](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~yas23/). I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science ([KNU](https://knu.ua/en/) '25), supervised by [Prof. Anatoly Anisimov](https://dblp.org/pid/72/5294.html).

My research focuses on the mathematical reasoning capabilities of language models. I study how changes in problem representation affect model performance, conduct human studies to compare reasoning patterns, and analyse how problem domain and complexity shape outcomes. I also develop methods for automated evaluation and synthetic data generation. You can find my research contributions at the [/research](/research) page.

Beyond academia, Iâ€™m passionate about STEM education for young learners. Iâ€™ve taught mathematics and programming, and coordinated educational initiatives including _NGO Kontora Pi_, _PIT School_, _Mathematical Olymp_. Iâ€™m also the co-founder and director of _Kvanta_, an educational STEM project for schoolchildren. Learn more on the [/stem-projects](/stem-projects) page.
