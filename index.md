Hi! 👋

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv](https://knu.ua/en/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Anatoly Anisimov](https://dblp.org/pid/72/5294.html) and a visiting postgraduate research student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/), advised by [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/) and [Dr. Yiannos Stathopoulos](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~yas23/).

My research focuses on the mathematical reasoning capabilities of language models. I study how changes in problem representation affect model performance, conduct human studies to compare reasoning patterns, and analyse how problem domain and complexity shape outcomes. I also develop methods for automated evaluation and synthetic data generation. You can find my research contributions at the [/research](/research) page.

Beyond academia, I’m passionate about STEM education for young learners. I’ve taught mathematics and programming, and coordinated educational initiatives including _NGO Kontora Pi_, _PIT School_, _Mathematical Olymp_. I’m also the co-founder and director of _Kvanta_, an educational STEM project for schoolchildren. Learn more on the [/stem-projects](/stem-projects) page.
