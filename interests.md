### Personal Interests

In my free time, I enjoy running, yoga, and exploring new places – I’ve completed a full marathon and multiple half-marathons across different countries.

I'm multimodal in my content preferences: I watch series, movies, read books and play video games.  
I appreciate both literary classics and immersive fantasy worlds – some of my favourites include _The Witcher_ and _Lord of the Rings_.

I’m also into a variety of sports and games. Always happy to join for a game of ♟️⚽️ 🏀 🏸 🏓 🀄 and more!
