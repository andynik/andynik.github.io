### Personal Interests

In my free time, I enjoy running, practicing yoga, and exploring new places.  
I have completed 9 half-marathons and a full marathon. I have been to Zanzibar, Japan, India and other places.

I am multimodal in my content preferences: I watch series, movies, read books and play video games.  
My reading spans from dark dystopias to fantasy classics, including _1984_, _Catch-22_, _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_, _Dune_ etc.
I enjoy immersive fantasy worlds and character-driven stories, including _The Witcher_, _Harry Potter_, _Lord of the Rings_, _Avatar_ etc.

I'm into ⚽️ 🏀 🏐 🏸 🏓 ♟️ 🏒 🎿 ⛸ 🏊‍♂️ 🚴‍ 🥾️ – up for a challenge or to play together!
