### Personal Interests

In my free time, I enjoy running, yoga, and exploring new places – I’ve completed a full marathon and 9 half-marathons across several countries.

I'm multimodal in my content preferences: I watch series, movies, read books and play video games.  
I appreciate both literary classics and immersive fantasy worlds — some of my favourites include the works of _Andrzej Sapkowski_, _J.R.R. Tolkien_, and _Ray Bradbury_.  

I’m also into a variety of sports and activities. Always happy to join for a game of ⚽️ 🏀 🏸 🏓 ♟️ 🀄 and more!
