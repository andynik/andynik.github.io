### Personal Interests

In my free time, I enjoy running, practicing yoga, and exploring new places.  
I have completed 9 half-marathons and a full marathon. I have been to Tanzania, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Dominican Republic and other places.

I am multimodal in my content preferences: I watch series, movies, read books and play video games.  
My reading spans from classics, science fiction to dystopian genres, e.g. _1984_, _The Count of Monte Cristo_, _Catch-22_, _The Illustrated Man_, _The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ to name a few.
I enjoy immersive fantasy worlds and character-driven stories as in _The Witcher_, _Harry Potter_, _Lord of the Rings_, _Dune_, _Avatar_ etc.

I like trying new sports and activities. I'm into ⚽️ 🏀 🏐 🏸 🏓 ♟️🀄 🏒 🎿 ⛸ 🏊 🚴‍ 🏄 🥾️– always up for a challenge or a friendly match!
